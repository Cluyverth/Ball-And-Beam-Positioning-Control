# Ball & Beam Positioning Control

Prototype of a Ball & Beam Positioning Control using Arduino.

*I did this project in college, the code isn't polished, but it works.*

---
## Tips
---
    Use Arduino IDE to code and compile the project, also use TinkerCad to test the code.
    You can simulate without the need to have an Arduino and Hardware.
